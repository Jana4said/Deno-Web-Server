# 🌐 Deno Web Server

A lightweight web server built using **Deno**, capable of serving static files, handling multiple MIME types, and validating HTTP requests.  
This project demonstrates core web concepts such as asynchronous programming, server routing, and content-type management.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Serves files dynamically from the `./www` directory
- Supports additional MIME types (like PDF)
- Responds only to **GET** requests
- Loads the **"Page Not Found"** message from a file instead of hardcoding
- Handles invalid paths using **Regex**
- Implements **error handling** for missing or invalid files

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Using **Deno** to serve files and handle requests  
- Applying **asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)** for file operations  
- Managing MIME types dynamically  
- Handling HTTP errors gracefully  
- Using **Regex** for URL path extraction  

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Deno Runtime**
- **Regular Expressions**
- **HTTP/GET Protocols**
